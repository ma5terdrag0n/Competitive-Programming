# Graph Theory: 
Graph : A network in which nodes are connected to each other with the help of edges.

# Type:
1. Unweighted vs weighted
2. Cyclic vs acyclic
3. unidirectional vs bidirectional

# Graph representation:
1. Adjacency matrix
2. Adjacency list: <a href = "http://sleepincode.blogspot.com/2017/07/graph-adjacency-list-using-stl-in-c-for.html" > Link</a>

# Graph traversal algorithms:
1. DFS : <a href = "http://sleepincode.blogspot.com/2017/07/depth-first-search-in-c.html" > Link </a>
2. BFS : <a href = "http://sleepincode.blogspot.com/2017/07/breadth-first-search-in-c.html" > Link </a>

# Some Basic algorithms of graphs traversal:
1. Connected components in a graph : <a href = "http://sleepincode.blogspot.com/2017/07/finding-connected-components-using-dfs.html" > Link </a>
2. Toplogical sorting on a directed acyclic graph : <a href = "http://sleepincode.blogspot.com/2017/07/topological-sort-on-directed-acyclic.html" > Link </a>

# Minimum spanning trees:
Wikipedia definition: A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted (un)directed graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. 
<br>Applications: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree#Applications" > WIKI LINK </a>

## Algorithms:
1. Prims
2. Krushkal : DSU is used for this algorithm.

# Shortest Path Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between source and destination..
  - It uses positve weights only. It means it is not valid for negative weights.
